                    As with anything new, considering a plant-based diet can bring up all sorts of questions and concerns. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about taking up a plant-based diet.

                <h2>
                    WHAT IS A PLANT-BASED DIET?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    It’s a dietary lifestyle that maximizes the intake of whole, plant-foods and minimizes the intake of processed and animal-derived foods. It’s a diet based on foods-as-grown: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, chickpeas, split peas, lentils, mushrooms, herbs, spices and small amounts of seeds and nuts. Consumption of meat (including chicken and fish), dairy products, and eggs, as well as highly refined foods like bleached flour, refined sugar, and oil are minimized. For inspiration about plant based eating.

                <h2>
                    I FEEL HEALTHY ENOUGH ON MY CURRENT DIET, WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER GOING PLANT-BASED?
                </h2>


                <p>
                    Most of us don’t realize that the foods we eat — three meals a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks each year — often have more of an impact on our health than anything else in our lives. Each bite we consume is either one step toward health, or one step toward disease. Plant-based diets have been directly associated to a lot of health benefits such as lower risk of heart disease, reversing type 2 diabetes, and preventing/reversing even cancer. In addition, plant-based diets are great for maintaining your weight. People following a diet that is centered on vegetables and whole grains generally weigh less than non-vegetarians.

                <h2>
                    IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PLANT-BASED DIET AND A VEGAN DIET?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a vegan diet, people avoid animal-based products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. While people who eat a whole food plant-based diet are similar to vegans in avoiding animal-based products, they also avoid processed foods, including oil, white flour, and refined sugar. A plant based diet is centered on unprocessed or minimally processed veggies, fruit, whole grains, beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

                <h2>
                    CAN YOU GET FULL EATING ONLY PLANTS?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wonderful thing about eating plants is that you’re eating lots of fiber, and fiber makes you very  full. Keep in mind, the less processed the plants are, the more nutrients you’re eating, which helps make you feel pleasantly full. Nutrients fill your cells with vitamins and minerals, which leaves you satisfied, but not stuffed. Also, the diversity of texture in plants require you to chew more, you actually spend more time getting through the meal. So a big bowl of salad with lots of stuff in it may not seem that heavy, but it can fill you up quite fast.

                <h2>
                    IS IT NUTRITIONALLY ADEQUATE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO EAT ONLY PLANTS?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    YES! A plant-based diet that includes a variety of foods and food groups contains everything needed to nourish us at any life stage. Children who eat a plant-based diet experience normal growth and development, and their risk of diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes is much lower than children who eat a Standard American Diet. Children raised on a plant-based diet also experience lower rates of acne, allergies and digestive issues. Eating habits are formed at an early age. By introducing whole, plant foods to children, you are laying the foundation for them to become healthy eaters for life. For growing children, adolescents and teens, adequate calorie intake is crucial. Because of this, they need to consume more fat than adults to meet their needs. Incorporate foods like avocados, nuts, seeds and nut and seed butters into their meals. Children can get optimal nutrition important for growth — such as protein, iron and calcium — from whole, plant foods and fortified foods like non-dairy milks and whole grain cereals. Just like adults on plant-based diets, children on plant-based diets need adequate B12. The most reliable source is a B12 supplement.

                <h2>
                    DOES EATING PLANT-BASED HELP PEOPLE LOSE WEIGHT?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing to eat a specific way just for weight loss is never a good idea. Haven’t we all tried that? If weight-loss diet plans aren’t aligned for true health reasons they almost always backfire on us because they lack beneficial long-term results. Focusing only on weight loss or calorie counting can be extremely exhausting and oftentimes depressing. However, by following a plant-based healthy lifestyle, you’re focusing on eating well-balanced and nutrient-dense meals. You will start to feel great because your body isn’t deprived thus it functions efficiently. You will see that you’ll start to lose weight naturally.
