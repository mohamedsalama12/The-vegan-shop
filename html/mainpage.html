            <h2>Veganism</h2>
            <p>
                Veganism is becoming increasingly popular.<br />

                In the past few years, several celebrities have gone vegan, and a wealth of vegan products have appeared in stores.<br />

                However, you may still be curious about what this eating pattern involves — and what you can and can’t eat on a vegan diet. <br />

                This article tells you everything you need to know about veganism.<br />
            </p> <br /> <br />

            <h2>What is Veganism</h2>
            <p>
                The term “vegan” was coined in 1944 by a small group of vegetarians who broke away from the Leicester Vegetarian Society in England to form the Vegan Society.<br /><br />

                They chose not to consume dairy, eggs, or any other products of animal origin, in addition to refraining from meat, as do vegetarians.<br /><br />

                The term “vegan” was chosen by combining the first and last letters of “vegetarian.”<br /><br />

                Veganism is currently defined as a way of living that attempts to exclude all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty, be it from food, clothing, or any other purpose.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h2>Why do people go vegan?</h2>
            <p>
                Vegans generally choose to avoid animal products for one or more of the following reasons.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Ethics
            </h3>
            <p>
                Ethical vegans strongly believe that all creatures have the right to life and freedom.<br /><br />

                Therefore, they oppose ending a conscious being’s life simply to consume its flesh, drink its milk, or wear its skin — especially because alternatives are available.<br /><br />

                Ethical vegans are also opposed to the psychological and physical stress that animals may endure as a result of modern farming practices.<br /><br />

                For instance, ethical vegans deplore the small pens and cages in which many livestock live and often rarely leave between birth and slaughter.<br /><br />

                What’s more, many vegans speak out against the farming industry’s practices, such as the grinding of live male chicks by the egg industry or the force-feeding of ducks and geese for the foie gras market.<br /><br />

                Ethical vegans may demonstrate their opposition by protesting, raising awareness, and choosing products that don’t involve animal agriculture.<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            <h3>
                Health
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some people choose veganism for its potential health effects.

                For example, plant-based diets may reduce your risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and premature death. <br /><br />

                Lowering your intake of animal products may likewise reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease or dying from cancer or heart disease.<br /><br />

                Some also choose veganism to avoid the side effects linked to the antibiotics and hormones used in modern animal agriculture.<br /><br />

                Finally, studies consistently link vegan diets to a lower body weight and body mass index (BMI). Some people may choose these diets to lose weight.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>
                Environment
            </h3>
            <p>
                People may also choose to avoid animal products because of the environmental impact of animal agriculture.<br /><br />

                A 2010 United Nations (UN) report argued that these products generally require more resources and cause higher greenhouse gas emissions than plant-based options (17).<br /><br />

                For instance, animal agriculture contributes to 65% of global nitrous oxide emissions, 35–40% of methane emissions, and 9% of carbon dioxide emissions (18).<br /><br />

                These chemicals are considered the three principal greenhouse gasses involved in climate change.<br /><br />

                Furthermore, animal agriculture tends to be a water-intensive process. For example, 550–5,200 gallons (1,700–19,550 liters) of water are needed to produce 1 pound (0.5 kg) of beef.<br /><br />

                That’s up to 43 times more water than is needed to produce the same amount of cereal grains.<br /><br />

                Animal agriculture can also lead to deforestation when forested areas are burned for cropland or pasture. This habitat destruction is thought to contribute to the extinction of various animal species.<br /><br />

            <h2>Types of veganism</h2>
            
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span>Dietary vegans.</span> Often used interchangeably with “plant-based eaters,” this term refers to those who avoid animal products in their diet but continue to use them in other products, such as clothing and cosmetics.</li> 
                <li><span>Whole-food vegans.</span> These individuals favor a diet rich in whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.</li>
                <li><span>Junk-food vegans.</span> Some people rely heavily on processed vegan food, such as vegan meats, fries, frozen dinners, and desserts, including Oreo cookies and non-dairy ice cream.</li>
                <li><span>Raw-food vegans.</span> This group eats only foods that are raw or cooked at temperatures below 118°F (48°C).</li>
                <li><span>Low-fat, raw-food vegans.</span> Also known as fruitarians, this subset limits high-fat foods, such as nuts, avocados, and coconuts, instead relying mainly on fruit. Other plants are occasionally eaten in small amounts.</li>

            <h2>Foods that vegan avoid</h2>
            <p>
                Vegans avoid all foods of animal origin. These include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>meat</li>
                <li>chicken</li>
                <li>fish</li>
                <li>shellfish</li>
                <li>eggs</li>
                <li>dairy</li>
                <li>honey</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Moreover, vegans avoid any animal-derived ingredients, such as albumin, casein, carmine, gelatin, pepsin, shellac, isinglass, and whey.<br /><br />

                Foods containing these ingredients include some types of beer and wine, marshmallows, breakfast cereals, gummy candies, and chewing gum.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h2>Foods that vegans eat</h2>
            <p>
                Avoiding animal products doesn’t consign you to veggies and tofu alone.<br /><br />

                In fact, many common dishes are already vegan or can be adjusted easily.<br /><br />

                Some examples include bean burritos, veggie burgers, tomato pizzas, smoothies, nachos with salsa and guacamole, hummus wraps, sandwiches, and pasta dishes.<br /><br />

                Meat-based entrées are generally swapped for meals containing the following:<br />
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>beans</li>
                <li>lentils</li>
                <li>tofu</li>
                <li>seitan</li>
                <li>tempeh</li>
                <li>nuts</li>
                <li>seeds</li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                You can replace dairy products with plant milks, scrambled eggs with scrambled tofu, honey with plant-based sweeteners like molasses or maple syrup, and raw eggs with flax or chia seeds.<br /><br />

                In addition, vegans tend to consume a variety of whole grains, as well as a wide array of fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />


                Finally, you can also choose from an ever-growing selection of ready-made vegan products, including vegan meats, fortified plant milks, vegan cheeses, and desserts.<br /><br />


                However, these highly processed products may be loaded with additives, oils, and artificial ingredients.<br /><br />
